## OVERVIEW
This project is centered on the development of a multiple linear regression model with the primary objective of predicting property prices in the real estate market. The focal point of this analysis is the dependent variable, "price," while the independent variables encompass a comprehensive range of property characteristics. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, the number of bedrooms, year built, number of floors in the home, total living space area in square feet, overall condition of the home, and the geographical location of the property.

Real estate agencies play a critical role in assisting homeowners with crucial decisions related to buying, selling, or renting properties. This project introduces a powerful tool for empowering real estate agencies â€“ a regression-based model designed to predict potential increases in property value. This model relies on various features influenced by property characteristics, including the number of bedrooms, year built, number of floors, total living space area in square feet, overall condition of the home, and the location.
